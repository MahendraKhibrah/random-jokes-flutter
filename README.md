**IMPLEMENTATION OF CLEAN ARCHITECTURE TEMPLATE FOR FLUTTER**

This repository serves as a template Flutter project implementing the Clean Architecture design pattern. Clean Architecture is a software design approach that separates the application into distinct layers, each with its own responsibilities and dependencies. The goal is to create a modular and maintainable codebase that is easily testable and adaptable to changes.

Dependency Injection with `get_it`
API Communication with `dio`
State Management using `cubit`
